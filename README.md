# Movies ETL - Extract, Transform, Load

## Overview

At Amazing Prime Video (the streaming site for the world's largest retailer), they have decided that they haven't yet made enough money, and they need to make even more!  One good way to do that is to pre-emptively predict which low-budget movies will become popular so that they can take advantage and scoop them up on the cheap, maximizing profits.  In order to make those predictions, the company is hosting a hack-a-thon where teams are tasked with predicting popular pictures.  In order to do this, they need a clean set of data to work with, which is where we come in.  We were given huge amounts of data from both Wikipedia and MovieLens, but this data is not always clean, uniform, complete, or even accurate.  It was our job to extract the data, clean it (as best as possible), and combine it in one relatively easy to read location.  After completing that task, the Amazing Prime team decided that they liked the work so much that they want it so that it can be updated on a regular basis.  As a result, we were then tasked with taking our original ETL code, refactoring it into a formula (instead of a one-time use code), and ultimately loading our cleaned and updated data into a PostgreSQL database.
